00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:06,300
Hi, I'm Thomas Brodhead. I'm the editor of the Critical Performance Edition of the Ives Fourth Symphony, and in this video

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:13,840
we're going to talk about the collapse section in the second movement: it's a passage in which the orchestra divides into two groups, and one group

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,320
accelerates on top of the other group and then collapses.

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,200
This passage is well known and has been written about extensively,

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,040
but there are some new things in it that have been unearthed in the new edition and

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,400
it's a great starting point for the entire series,

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,760
I think, so let's jump right into it.

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,840
So first we're going to look at the full score using the notation that Ives provided,

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,640
which doesn't really clarify how the passage is to be executed.

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,440
To get the clarification you need to read the gloss on this passage that Ives provided in a separate Conductor's Note -

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,080
we'll get to that in a bit. But first let's just focus on the original state of the notation.

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,120
We're starting by looking at the measures that lead to the collapse section proper focusing on the music in the strings,

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,760
which are playing a treatment of In the Sweet By and By in 3/2,

14
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,240
but with triplets set off by a quarter -

15
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,160
this is exactly the kind of thing that Ives likes to do, shifting music so that it's out of step, right?

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,120
But the larger point is that the strings are playing slowly and quietly.

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,840
This continues on to the next page.

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,760
But then when you turn that page, winds and brass enter playing louder and faster moving material.

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,880
Additionally, they're playing in 4/4 against the 3/2 of the strings who haven't changed their meter at all.

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,520
As you go through the pages of this section,

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,000
it continues like this - with the winds and brass playing faster-looking music with lots of quarters, eighths, and sixteenths,

22
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,600
while the strings remain in 3/2 with halves and quarters dominating their rhythms.

23
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:46,040
Finally on the fourth page of this pandemonium, the instruction 'fall away' appears above the top staff.

24
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:53,760
At the same time at the bottom, there's a note above the basses' final measure above a tremolo cluster chord that they play that says

25
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,240
'Basses start this with upper orchestra, not necessarily with lower orchestra unless they happen to be together'

26
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,600
This note by Ives wasn't in the 1965 score: it's appearing in the new edition for the first time.

27
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,280
We'll get to what it means in a bit, but back to what the total orchestra is doing.

28
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:17,360
When you flip to the next page, all the winds and brass have vanished and the material in the strings, that treatment of In the

29
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,240
Sweet By and By in 3/2, is exposed again. It never had stopped - it continued unabated while the winds and brass were playing.

30
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,560
So what exactly happened in this passage?

31
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:34,360
It looks like the winds and brass enter in 4/4 time, and play an even division of the 4/4 against the strings

32
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,360
3/2 throughout, right?

33
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,460
Nope! Ives lacked a way to indicate with conventional notation what he intended,

34
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,160
so he resorted to a written gloss on the passage to explain his intentions,

35
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,560
and if, in the past, an interpreter did read that gloss, it was often misinterpreted. Let's take a look at it.

36
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,040
The gloss is found in a collection of memos Ives made about the Comedy movement and he simply titled it:

37
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,000
'Conductor's Note'. It's the only thing interpreters of the score had in the past as a reference to Ives's intentions.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,720
Ives's writing in it is a thicket at times and you often have to read his sentences three times over before they sink in

39
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,080
and make sense...

40
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,600
Let's look at what he said about the passage in question. He wrote:

41
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,960
'The instruments are divided here into two separate orchestrasl the lower continuing the preceding adagio, while the upper,

42
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,240
including woodwind, brass, timpani, and both pianos, break suddenly in,

43
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,480
canceling the sounds of the lower orchestra (unless its players can be placed near enough to the majority of listeners

44
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,880
or the upper orchestra removed sufficiently so that it may, in a way, be heard through the lower).

45
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,600
Both groups may keep in the time relation indicated on this page,

46
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:51,240
but at the beginning of the next page the upper orchestra begins to play faster and faster until the "collapse" indicated,

47
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,960
but which will occur sooner - perhaps toward the end of the previous page.

48
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:01,200
Care must be taken that the lower orchestra in no way increases its tempo or intensity through here.

49
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:08,160
After the upper orchestra has stopped, the lower must sound quietly on as if it had been oblivious of the disturbance.

50
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,200
During this passage it may be advisable to have one of the players of the upper orchestra act as a separate conductor.'

51
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,040
So,

52
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,720
here Ives is explaining that the total orchestra is split: the strings and percussion

53
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:28,800
constitute a lower orchestra playing in 3/2, while the winds, brass, timpani, and pianos constitute an upper orchestra playing in 4/4.

54
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,560
Ives then explains that starting on the second page of the split passage,

55
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:40,320
the upper orchestra accelerates its tempo until it collapses, and then the lower orchestra finishes the passage a bit later

56
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,840
following the tempo that it's maintained all along.

57
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:49,640
Many fine conductors of the old 1965 score did read this passage and did attempt to realize it,

58
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:56,120
but few of them noticed that the acceleration of the upper orchestra is to begin on the second page of the split passage.

59
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:03,000
Either they began the acceleration on the first page of the split, or worse, they applied no acceleration whatsoever.

60
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:10,240
This is understandable, however, because Ives's writing is dense, and nothing in the full score of this passage makes this clear.

61
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,720
So this means that for the first page of the split the meters of the two groups are evenly divided:

62
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,960
it's an exact 4/4 against 3/2 with measure equals measure between the groups.

63
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,080
But then on the second page of the split the 4/4 group begins to accelerate.

64
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:34,040
When the 4/4 group collapses, the 3/2 group continues on wherever it happens to be in relation to the 4/4 group,

65
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,600
and then the two groups realigns seamlessly at the beginning of the next page without any pause.

66
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:46,200
Ives's commentary is preserved in this edition, but the performance score itself needed to convey this information notationally:

67
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:52,520
there needed to be a way of clarifying for the conductor when the two groups are playing an even division of 3/2 against 4/4,

68
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,120
and when the upper group is no longer aligned with the lower group, but is accelerating on top of it.

69
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,680
So here's how it's solved...

70
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:07,160
Now we're looking at the Performance Score (before we were looking at the engraving of Ives's original notation in the Critical Edition).

71
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,960
Here during the measures leading up to the split it looks pretty much the same;

72
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,040
about the only exception is that the notation in the strings has been revised slightly

73
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,000
so that the beat locations of the offset triplets are clear.

74
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:25,400
But then after the soft introductory passage, when you then turn the page and get to the split...

75
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,120
Presto! The score is divided into a very clear graphical separation of the two groups.

76
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,880
Here's the upper orchestra, and below it is the lower orchestra.

77
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,880
It's extremely helpful to separate the groups and put their instruments in score order within each bracketed division,

78
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,280
That way the conductor of each section can easily see which instruments belong to it.

79
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:52,120
Incidentally, the instruments in the upper orchestra here are pretty much the same as what you'd find on the top of a standard score order page,

80
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,080
and the same could be said of the instruments in the lower orchestra,

81
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,520
so bracketing the instruments like this may not seem like a giant leap forward in the score's notation.

82
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,440
But in other places in the symphony there are hodgepodge collections of instruments that form different groups,

83
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,160
each in its own meter, and for those passages, it's clearest to bracket them separately

84
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,720
just as is done here, and in standard score order within each bracketing.

85
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,600
That way the conductor of each metered group can see which players belong to that group,

86
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,240
and the groups may then be rehearsed independently before being brought together en masse.

87
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,120
But back to the collapse section... Here on the first page of the split,

88
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,200
there's an even division of the upper orchestra's 4/4 against the lower orchestra's

89
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,720
3/2, with the measure lengths equal and all rhythms spaced appropriately.

90
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:45,160
But then when you look at the next page, you'll see one, two, three measures in the upper orchestra against

91
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,720
two measures in the lower orchestra.

92
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:54,040
This is where the upper orchestra is to begin its acceleration, so it's where the two groups split from each other temporally.

93
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,960
The desynchronization of the measures is a visual alert that something special is going on here,

94
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:07,720
and the tempo at the top further clarifies the intent. The upper orchestra accelerates while the lower orchestra maintains its previous tempo.

95
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,880
So,

96
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,360
looking on the next page, you'll see the same thing:

97
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:19,240
there are three measures in the upper orchestra against two below, with no syncing of internal rhythms as there would be if it were an exact

98
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,240
three against two, which it's not.

99
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,920
Finally on the next page the notation drives it home:

100
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:30,600
the upper orchestra has finished before the lower orchestra, with a huge gap of white space following it.

101
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,840
Any conductor looking at the notation and reading Ives's note will understand the intended execution of the passage.

102
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:43,720
This is an example of one of the goals I had for the edition: wherever possible let the notation communicate the intent.

103
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:51,000
But what about the note above the tremoloed chord in the basses? Remember it states 'Basses start this with upper orchestra,

104
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,440
not necessarily with the lower orchestra unless they happen to be together.'

105
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,400
It may now be obvious what Ives's intention is: when the upper orchestra collapses

106
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:05,240
the basses leap ahead to the tremoloed chord and hold it until the rest of the strings catch up with them.

107
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,520
The effect is that of the upper orchestra collapsing to the tremoloed chord like this (sings).

108
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,680
The bass parts explain this,

110
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:22,200
but there's now a cue in the full score as well, that reads 'On downbeat of measure 51 of the upper orchestra

111
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,720
immediately cue the contrabasses and the lower orchestra to jump ahead to their measure 51,

112
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,400
sustaining their tremolo until the downbeat of the next section.'

113
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,840
Between the instruction in the bass parts and the cue in the full score, this wonderful effect is now unlikely to be overlooked.

114
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,880
Following this the two orchestras seamlessly

115
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:49,400
resynchronize on the next page - as you can see here, the split orchestra notation with brackets is gone, and standard score notation has resumed.

116
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,480
But let's look back to the previous page the last page of the split.

117
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,840
Notice the text here that reads 'no pause'.

118
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:03,000
I added that because I know at least one conductor who misinterpreted a quirk of the old 1965 score,

119
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:12,360
which had fermatas on the final bar lines of the upper orchestra on this page.

121
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:19,160
The fermatas were added by the editors of the 1965 score who apparently understood Ives's gloss on this passage

122
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,760
and who were apparently trying to indicate that the upper orchestra pauses after its collapse

123
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,320
and waits for the lower orchestra to catch up with it.

124
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,360
But the conductor in question thought that the fermatas belonged to the entire orchestra,

125
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,560
and brought all the players to a pause - which is clearly not Ives's intent.

126
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:44,520
So the new edition clarifies Ives's intent and there are now a lot of good recordings of the new edition showcasing the passage.

127
00:10:44,520 --> 00:11:02,440
Let's close by listening to one of them with the score.
